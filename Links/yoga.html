        <div class="history">
            <h2>History of Yoga</h2>
            <p>The first mention of the word “yoga” appears in Rig Veda, a collection of ancient texts. Yoga comes from the Sanskrit word “yuj,” which means “union” or “to join.”
            Yoga can be traced back to northern India over 5,000 years ago.
            Indian monks spread their knowledge of yoga in the West during the late 1890s. Modern yoga teachings became widely popular in Western countries by the 1970s.</p>
