    <h1>Accupressure Techniques</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <p>Acupressure is a traditional Chinese healing method that involves applying pressure to specific points on the body to stimulate the body's natural self-healing abilities. It is based on the concept of Qi (vital energy) flowing through pathways called meridians. By pressing on these acupressure points, practitioners aim to restore balance and improve health.</p>
